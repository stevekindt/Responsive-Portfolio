                            After working in the medical device industry for a number of years I decided that I wanted
                            to find a
                            creative outlet
                            in my professional life. I thought that web design would be a good opportunity to exercise
                            this
                            desire. I was also
                            drawn to the idea that the field is constantly changing with new technologies and frameworks
                            requiring non-stop learning.
                            After buying a few coding books and taking some free courses online, I decided to get
                            serious and
                            invest in this new
                            path by enrolling in a coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota.</p>
                        <p>As a new web design student I am excited to begin my journey toward a challenging and
                            rewarding profession. Building this simple web portfolio has been my first real test. One
                            day soon
                            I hope to look back on this exercise and its underlying styling with a mix of pride and
                            slight
                            embarassment
                            as my skills have developed.</p>
