            <p>After working in the medical device industry for a number of years I decided that I wanted to find a
                creative outlet
                in my professional life. I thought that web design would be a good opportunity to exercise this
                desire. I was also
                drawn to the idea that the field is constantly changing with new technologies and frameworks
                requiring non-stop learning.
                After buying a few coding books and taking some free courses online, I decided to get serious and
                invest in this new
                path by enrolling in a coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota.</p>
            <p>As a new web design student I am excited to begin my journey toward a challenging and
                rewarding profession. Building this simple web portfolio has been my first real test. One day soon
                I hope to look back on this exercise and its underlying styling with a mix of pride and slight embarassment
                as my skills have developed.</p>
